# Hi, I'm Gianni

Iâ€™m a product manager turned engineer.

Both at and outside of work, I have a perpetual drive to think about the ways software can augment our lives in novel, private and delightful ways.
Most recently, I built [DataLoaf](https://data-loaf.com/)â€“an open-source, self-hostable product analytics platform. You might enjoy checking it out through [this comprehensive case study](https://data-loaf.com/docs/category/case-study).

If you want to reach out to me, the best way is [via email](mailto:personalsite.unchain294@passmail.net).
